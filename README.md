# TYNYS
The TYNYS project is a small air purifier that uses static electricity to trap tiny dust particles (PM2.5). It sucks in pollutants with charged plates, which cuts down on bad stuff in the air indoors and at factories. We're trying to make good air purification cheap, energy-saving, and way more budget-friendly than what's out there now.
